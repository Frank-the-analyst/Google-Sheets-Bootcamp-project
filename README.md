"# Google-Sheets-Bootcamp-project" 


In this project I was tasked with cleaning a dataset before then using Google Visualization API Query Language to complete different queries/tasks on the data.  Following this I created a dashboard in Google Sheets based on the cleaned dataset.

Unfortunately due to having to download this file as a Excel file inorder to upload to GitHub much of the dashboard functionality has dissapeared.  However, you can still see how I cleaned the data and used Google Visualization API Query Language in this link.

Thanks for reading this far!
